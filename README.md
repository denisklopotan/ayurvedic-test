## Testing 

Webpage passed all validator testings with excellent results.
HTML is simply made and responsive on all devices and screen sizes.

Minor future adjustments needed for mobile devices, relating to result area, kapha result is pushed in a new line while resising to mobile size. Would be more estheticaly pleasing to keep results in one line on all devices.
