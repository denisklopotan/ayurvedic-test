        <h1>Ancient science of Ayurveda</h1>
        <p>
            The ancient health science of Ayurveda is built around the five elements of ether, air, fire, water, and earth.
            The unique combination of these elements come together to make up the doshas, or constitutions—vata, pitta, and kapha.
            Each dosha has a number of corresponding qualities that are expressed in the physical, emotional, and mental aspects of one’s being.
            All of us have some aspects of each dosha, but one or two doshas tend to dominate, informing everything from our digestion to our emotions.
